# ViaBungee

> [!WARNING]  
> This currently only works if **both client and server are below 1.20.2**. if you want 1.21 Support, Migrate to Velocity, link ViaProxy with the proxy using the ViaProxyMultiLauncher, Install ViaVersion On Backend, or make a start.bat that starts both VIAaaS and Bungeecord.

See https://github.com/ViaVersion/ViaVersion for the main project. Note that we recommend putting ViaVersion on your
backend servers, switching to Velocity, Or Use VIAaaS/ViaProxy, as ViaBungee is fairly unstable due to platform limitations.

## To get started

- Download the latest jar from https://hangar.papermc.io/ViaVersion/ViaBungee and put it into your BungeeCord plugins
  folder
- Download ViaVersion from https://viaversion.com/ (and other addons if needed) and put them into
  the `plugins/ViaVersion/` folder
