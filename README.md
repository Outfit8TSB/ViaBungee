# ViaBungee

> [!WARNING]  
> This currently only works if **both client and server are below 1.20.2**. for 1.20.3+, it is recommended to use ViaProxy or Switch to Velocity.

See https://github.com/ViaVersion/ViaVersion for the main project. Note that we recommend putting ViaVersion on your backend servers, or switching to Velocity as ViaBungee is Unstable.

If You Still Want to use Bungeecord API or dont want to switch to velocity, Use [ViaProxy](https://github.com/ViaVersion/ViaProxy).

## To get started

- Download the latest jar from https://hangar.papermc.io/ViaVersion/ViaBungee and put it into your BungeeCord plugins
  folder
- Download ViaVersion from https://viaversion.com/ (and other addons if needed) and put them into
  the `plugins/ViaVersion/` folder
