# ViaBungee

Not functional at the moment

<!--
See https://github.com/ViaVersion/ViaVersion for the main project. Note that we recommend putting ViaVersion on your
backend servers or switching to Velocity, as ViaBungee is fairly unstable due to platform limitations.

## To get started

- Download the latest jar from https://hangar.papermc.io/ViaVersion/ViaBungee and put it into your BungeeCord plugins
  folder
- Download ViaVersion from https://viaversion.com/ (and other addons if needed) and put them into
  the `plugins/ViaVersion/` folder
